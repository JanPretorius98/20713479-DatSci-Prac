# Introduction {-}

In the ever-evolving landscape of music, the growth and transformation of artists provide a captivating narrative that resonates with fans and researchers alike. This report analyses the musical evolution of Coldplay and Metallica, two legendary bands that have left an indelible mark on the industry for over two decades. By leveraging Spotify data and focusing on their studio recordings, I delve into intriguing metrics such as popularity, acousticness, danceability, tempo, and energy. Through a blend of insightful analysis and compelling visualizations, I aim to uncover the dynamic shifts and enduring influence of Coldplay and Metallica's musical evolution.

##      Artist evolution over time      {-}

```

During their tenures as A-list artists, both Coldplay and Metallica were both incredibly, and consistently, popular. Coldplay however, was more popular on average during their time as an artist. Looking at some of the metrics based on the characteristics of their music, it would seem that Metallica had a winning formula they were not willing to change. The standard deviation in their music tempo, energy, danceability, and acousticness were relatively small, indicating little difference in musical style accross time. On the other hand, Coldplay exhibit higher deviation in their musical metrics, showing willingness to experiment more with new styles. Particularly, acousticness and energy seems to differ quite dramatically from song to song. This warrants further investigation to determine whether these deviations a driven by new album releases, with more experimental styles.

```{r stream, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
# Filter for Coldplay and Metallica only
df_bands <- df %>% 
  filter(artist %in% c("Coldplay", "Metallica")) %>%
  group_by(artist, month_year) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_popularity = mean(popularity, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_acousticness = mean(acousticness, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_danceability = mean(danceability, na.rm = TRUE),

df_bands$month_year <- as.Date(paste(df_bands$month_year, "01", sep = "-"))

df_bands %>%
  filter(month_year > as.Date("1995-01-01")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month_year, y = value, fill = artist)) +

    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```
The plot allows us to compare the range and median popularity levels of the albums within each artist's discography. The differences in popularity patterns between Coldplay and Metallica become apparent, providing valuable insights into the varying dynamics of audience reception and appreciation over the years

##      Trends in Music     {-}

Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C illustrate the trends in popularity, energy, and acousticness respectively for Coldplay and Metallica over time. Each plot showcases the relationship between the metric and the release date, with different colors representing the two artists. The plots provide valuable insights into how these musical characteristics have evolved for both bands throughout their careers.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Filter for Coldplay and Metallica only
df_filtered <- df %>%

```
While Colplay is initially more popular then Metallica, their popularity exhibits a clear downward trend over time. This however, is due to the dismal performance of their album 'Every Day Life'. The release of '72 Seasons' by Metallica was a clear boost to their popularity and projected their popularity higher than Codlplay for the first time.

The energy trend shows consistent energy for both Coldplay and Metallica over time, with Metallica having consistently more energised music than Coldplay. 

In terms of acousticness, Metallica remained low, but consistent over time. Coldplay on the other hand show much more variability in the acousticness of their music.

##      Live performance vs Studio Recordings       {-}

Figures 4 to 7 showcase the distribution of different musical attributes for live and studio versions of songs by Coldplay and Metallica. Each figure focuses on a specific attribute, including popularity, energy, tempo, and danceability. The plots use violins and jittered points to display the distribution of values, with separate panels for each artist. The color palette distinguishes between live and studio versions. These figures provide insights into how these attributes vary between live performances and studio recordings for both bands.

```{r}

# Apply the is_live_version function to the 'name' column
df$version <- ifelse(mapply(is_live_version, df$name), "Live", "Studio")

# List of attributes
attributes <- c("popularity", "energy", "tempo", "danceability")

# Create a separate plot for each attribute
for (i in 1:length(attributes)) {
  attribute <- attributes[i]
  figure_number <- i + 3
  
  df_filtered <- df %>% 
    select(artist, version, {{ attribute }})
  
  # Generate the plot
  p <- df_filtered %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = version, y = !!sym(attribute), fill = version)) +
    facet_wrap(~ artist, scales = "free") +
    geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("Studio" = "#1669da", "Live" = "#96d6de")) +
    labs(
      title = paste("Figure", figure_number, ": Distribution of", attribute, "for live vs. studio versions"),
      x = "Version",
      y = "Value",
      fill = "Version"
    ) +
    th +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
  
  print(p)
}


```
The violin plots reveal interesting differences between live recordings and studio versions for Coldplay and Metallica.

For Coldplay, live recordings are less popular compared to studio versions, while Metallica shows similar levels of popularity in both settings. Coldplay's live performances exhibit higher energy, while Metallica maintains consistent energy across live and studio music. Surprisingly, Coldplay's live recordings have lower tempo compared to studio versions, whereas Metallica shows a slight decrease in tempo for live performances. Both bands have more danceable music in their studio recordings, possibly due to the inclusion of electronic and edited sounds that are challenging to reproduce live.
